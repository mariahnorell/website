## What is Human Resource Management?

At the core, human resource managment (HRM) is the function within an organization that manages all people-related issues. Human resource professionals face many challenges like retaining and rewarding the best employees, developing the next generation of corporate leaders, and creating a culture that attracts the best employees. To be successful in HRM, professionals must have a blend of technical, business, and communication skills.

### The Future of Work

There are many trends and disrupters entering the workforce, especially after covid-19 became a known threat. Moving to a fully virtual presence partnered with the prominence of alt-work (the gig economy) has shifted our lens of the traditional work day. Now more than ever, organizations must be ready to deal with the ebb and flow of the redesign of hours, flex time, remote work, anywhere work, and more.
