## Choosing an IDE

You can write Python code in numerous IDEs (integrated development environments). The Python language stays the same regardless of the IDE you choose to use, but each IDE may look different or have different features. Think of it this way, Gmail is still Gmail whether you use it in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

Examples of IDEs include:
- [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is an open source environment for individuals to write code and is helpful to all data analysts. Go to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to download Python 3.7 for your computer and follow all instruction prompts.

## Jupyter Notebook Basics

Jupyter Notebook is a very user friendly IDE that allows you to chunk out your code and write in text in a clear way. The way we add in this text is through something called *Markdown*. It is helpful to alternate between writing in Markdown and writing code, because it will visually organize the project you set out to accomplish. In addition, organizing your Notebook will help others (i.e., colleagues, interview committees, friends) understand your thought process.

Open up this [tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) to understand all necessary steps for running Jupyter and getting your first notebook ready.

While getting everything set up, locate a place on your computer that will be easy to access all notebooks for this class. It's recommended to utilize cloud-based storage tools like iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, rather than your desktop to ensure you do not lose any work.

### What is Markdown?

```md
### Hello, this is Markdown.
#### This font is a little smaller.
###### This font is even smaller. We can also write in *italic* and create numbered lists:
- Header
    - Second Level
        - Third Level

We can also write in **bold** and add links like [this one](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

> Blockquotes look like this and help highlight a key point you're trying to make.

Markdown is particularly helpful when we want to include notes about our code.
```

Now here's how the output looks:

---

Now that we have installed Anaconda and have Jupyter Notebook, we can begin coding!
