In this section, I'll provide an overview on Python.

<!-- find better place to put this: The goal of this section is to use Python to get high level descriptive or summary statistics in HR Analytic related projects. -->

## Programming

Programming is the process of designing and building a computer program to accomplish many tasks. Some examples include analyzing data, generating algorithms, implementing rules and validations, and much more!

## Python

Python is a programming language that was written by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s. This language became so popular because it was free and open sourced, meaning anyone can use it. This language quickly beame one of the most on demand languages to laern as it is very readable to the user. By 2018, over 8 million people were programming in Python and there's been a steady 8-10% increase in usership year-over-year. This language is great for beginners and is used by many different professionals in many different professions and industries, so it will be powerful to have in your analytics tool belt.

The best way to learn this language is to dive right into a project. The following sections in this book contain HR related examples and walkthroughs on how to use this powerful programming language to your advantage.

## Libraries

Programming languages have libraries that act as a collection of code that has been stored together in one single file. Using the designated code 'unlocks' your access to that library, which in turn allows you to do some pretty powerful computing. You can’t simply install Python and start writing commands. You will need to do your research on which libraries you need for your analysis. For now, we will begin with the Pandas library.
