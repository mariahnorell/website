# Introduction to Qualtrics

## What is Qualtrics?

Qualtrics is predominantly a survey tool that allows you to build questionnaires for others to answer. In the People Analytics field, the most popular surveys companies build follow the employee lifecycle journey and include some of the following:
- Onboarding surveys
- Engagement surveys
- Exit/Attrition surveys

## Survey Design

Another term for survey design is psychometrics, which is the theory and technique of measuring knowledge/skills/abilities, cognition, personality, and so much more. Commonly used methodologies include: surveys, questionnaires, assessments, and tests. Survey design is important to know in the People Analytics space because you may be asked to design or analyze a survey on employee engagement, an exit interview, or some other pulse on the employee population.

Surveys are a good tool to learn about your workforce. As a People Analytics professional, you may or may not work directly with the team that owns the employment surveys, but it is necessary to understand the science behind: 
- What makes a survey question 'good'
- Survey fatigue and how to fix it
- Qualitative vs. quantitative data from a survey
- How to analyze results from the survey in a way that makes sense

The following sections will dive into each of these themes so that you begin to feel more comfortable creating a survey in the future, if you are ever put in such a position.

### Writing Good Survey Items 

Have you ever taken a survey about your experience with a product or within an organization asking about your experience with the company? These are just two examples of many options that circulate business needs. If you have taken one before and have scratched your head, slightly confused at what the survey item was asking about, you are not alone! 

What makes a survey item bad? Take a look at the three items listed below and see if you can identify if these are `good` vs. `bad` and why?

``` 
1. Please rate the speed and accuracy of the help you received. 
2. My team is able to make quick and efficient decisions to get work done timely.
3. Thinking about your entire experience within the company, how would you rate your satisfaction?
```

If you thought these were ambiguous or worded in a confusing way, then you are correct! These would be considered `bad` survey items that we would not want to include in any customer or employee facing survey. 

Here's a list of guiding principals to keep in mind when creating survey items: 
| Avoid the use of:  | Why? |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Yes/No questions  | Analyzing this down the line will provide less meaningful insights |
| Using jargon  | If your survey taker cannot understand slang/jargon, they will not be able to answer the question to the best of their abilities |
| Being inconsistent with scales  | Could confuse the survey taker if they thought "agree" was always on the right and taking the survey quickly |
| Asking sensitive questions  | This starts to dissuade the survey taker for fear of being identified from results |
| Putting demographics at the front/top  | This often biases the survey taker to be less honest compared to putting them at the end |
| Ambiguity | Leads to ambiguous data analysis and less reliability in results |
| Double barreled questions | Survey taker can't respond to both items separately and reduces validity in the item |
