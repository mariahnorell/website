I'm a People Analytics and Insights Lead at Atlassian. I'm also an educator at San Jose State University where I teach intermediate and advanced People Analytics courses. I find it exciting to bring my scientist-practitioner background to the classroom and watch my students grasp the competencies of fundamental business principles. Previously, I was on the People Analytics team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and was a Data Scientist/Consultant at Aon helping companies elevate their HR strategy.
