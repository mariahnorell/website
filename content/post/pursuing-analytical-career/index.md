If you're just getting started, or decided to pivot your career into analytics, this guide is here to serve as the building blocks for your next steps.

## Skills Needed to Succeed

Analytics is having a moment right now, which makes sense because there is just so much data out there! People Analytics in particular is growing in popularity rapidly, with many organizations restructuring their workforce to account for such high demand. Below are some of the most important skills you'll need in order to be a competitive candidate.

1. Data Visualization
2. Curious, Inquisitive Mindset
3. Attention to Detail
4. HR and Business Acumen
5. Knowing a Programming Language

Essentially, it comes down to being able to combine quantitative and qualitative judgement, and being able to apply the knowledge and skills youâ€™ve learned along the way. Whichever path you decide to take, make sure you are applying the skills to real projects and not just memorizing terms.

> *Bonus Tip: Find yourself a mentor and create a GitHub account to have an online portfolio.

## Choosing a Path

The type of analyst you become is pretty universal amongst the various fields and industries. Here is a list of the types of jobs you could have and their typical duties. I recommend first choosing one of the three options below to begin your journey to finding a role on an analytics team.

| Job Type  | Typical Role | Skills Needed |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Analyst | Visualization and Communication of Data | Excel, SQL, Visualization (Tableau, Visier, etc.) |
| Data Scientist | Modeling Data and Automation | Statistics, SQL, Python, R |
| Data Engineer | Database Administrator, Data Architect | Advanced Programming, ETL |

## Common Job Titles

For those interested in the People Analytics field, there are a variety of job titles that stand out from the typical 'Data Analyst' naming structure. Here's a list of some common job titles.

- Business Architect/Specialist
- HR Analyst/Associate
- People Analytics Associate
- Talent Acquisition Analyst
- Workforce Analyst

## Where to Get Started

Now that you know some of the general skills needed and the typical career options, it's time to make a game plan for yourself to learn the material you need to be successful. The two major choices you should consider is (1) whether you want to continue your educational career by going to graduate school, or (2) if you want to go at your own pace and enroll in online certifications.

### Graduate Programs vs. Certifications

Typically, Data Engineers and Data Scientists have advanced degrees in a STEM-related field and Data Analysts have undergraduate degrees with relevant experience. Don't feel pressured into getting a graduate degree, however, as you can always work your way up through gaining on-the-job experiences!

### Graduate Programs

If you're considering graduate school, I recommend first paying attention to the name of the program and review the actual courses taught to see if it meets your expectations. Take it a step further by requesting access to the syllabus to actually see what content is covered in the curriculum and assess your own skillset. Lastly, be wary of the entry requirements (some graduate programs require STEM courses like calculus to be completed before entry) and determine whether you can afford it.

> Many programs can cost between $50K-270K and take 1-4 years to complete.

Here are some of the most common Master and PhD graduate programs for an analytics career fo

- Business Analytics
- Computer Science
- Data Analytics
- Data Science
- HR Analytics
- I/O Psychology
- Machine Learning

### Certifications (MOOCs)

MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, are extremely popular for continued education resources, and for many great reasons - they're cheaper and more flexible. While many of the MOOCs provide a badge of completion or a certification after passing an assessment, some are even offering full-fledged degrees! Here's a list of my favorite MOOCs and suggested courses on building an analytical skillset that employers are looking for.

## General Advice

One of the best pieces of advice given to me was to start small. It can be overwhelming trying to learn everything - you don't need to become an expert over night!
